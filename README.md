# Duffle
> A Programming Language Where Everything Goes In The Duffle Bag

A Language built on the concept of simplifying and unifying technology 
to make apps take minutes to create rather than years. Designed to be primarily
Procedural or Declarative with the ability to customize backends for a unified 
syntax. The language makes some dangerous design choices: No Scoped Literals, 
No Mutable Variables, No Object Inheritence. Trying to learn from other system
languages like C, Rust, Go, and Haskell, Duffle features static typing with Generics,
functional annotations for behaviors, and inferenced types from expressions

## Goals
1. Don't Repeat Yourself
2. Write it Fast and Clean
3. Anyone can code
4. CPU Performance > Memory Performance

# Pre-Release
Currently the language is still in pre release while we work on the following features:
- [ ] Executable Output from Parsed intermediate representation
- [ ] Heap Memory Management via Code and GC
- [ ] Customizeable Backend Generation From Code 
- [ ] Minimal Dependency Builds via [gasm](https://github.com/tflexsoom/gasm)
